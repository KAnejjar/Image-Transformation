# Image-Transformation
Welcome to this Image Processing Project!

This project is designed to take your images to the next level. By applying a variety of filters, we transform your photos into unique and visually stunning pieces of art.

The process is simple - just upload your image and choose from a selection of filters in the main section, including vintage-gothic, and modern black and white. Our algorithms will then apply the selected filter to your image, resulting in a one-of-a-kind creation that you can share with the world.

Our project is built using cutting-edge image processing techniques and is constantly evolving to include new and exciting features. Whether you're a professional photographer looking to add a new dimension to your work, or simply someone who loves to experiment with images, this project is the perfect tool for you.

--------------Libs used-----------------

-OpenCV: OpenCV is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It provides tools for image and video processing, including image recognition, tracking, and segmentation.

-Pillow: Pillow is a fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL) that adds support for newer Python versions and additional features. It provides tools for opening, manipulating, and saving image files.

-NumPy: NumPy is a numerical computing library that provides tools for working with large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. It is often used for scientific computing and data analysis tasks.

-Pixellib: Pixellib is a library for pixel-level image segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. It is built on top of TensorFlow and Keras and provides pre-trained models for a variety of tasks.

-SciPy: SciPy is a library for scientific computing that provides tools for optimization, linear algebra, signal processing, and more. It is often used in research and engineering applications.

-glob: glob is a module in Python's standard library that provides tools for searching directories for files that match a particular pattern or set of patterns.

-random: random is a module in Python's standard library that provides tools for generating random numbers and sequences. It is often used in simulations, games, and other applications where randomness is needed.
